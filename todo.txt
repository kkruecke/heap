1. To port levelOrderTraverse() from tree234, it is probably best to implement a custom iterator class like that in tree234. This would require changing heap to have a nested type of "value_type" that would be std::pair<int, T>. This will
force the other existing methods to be changed slightly. So it is best to first test the code after adding the std::pair<int, T> and then again after adding the iterator class.

The new code is in new-heap.h


2. Test min_heap using the method printLevelOrder().
